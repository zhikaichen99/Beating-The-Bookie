# Beating The Bookie

The objective of this project is to create a predictive model that calculates the probability of a player prop and uses the probabilities to determine whether the prop is worth betting on. Props with a higher probability score will be identified as good bets.

## Project Motivation

The motivation for this project is to develop a tool that can help sports bettors make more informed and strategic decisions when placing bets on player props. Player props are a type of bet that involves wagering on the performance of a specific player, such as the number of points they will score.
